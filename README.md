# Hijri Watchface

An Arabic Hijri calendar watchface for the Pebble. Displays the time, Hijri and Gregorian calendars.

The date calculation is done using what's called a “tabular Islamic calendar”, with the usual 30-year leap cycle on years 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26 and 29.

## Building

This now uses Pebble's SDK 2.0. Just run `pebble build` to build an app bundle.
