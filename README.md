# Hijri Watchface

An Arabic Hijri calendar watchface for the Pebble. Displays the time, Hijri and Gregorian calendars.

The date calculation is done using the “tabular Islamic calendar”, with the usual 30-year leap cycle on years 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26 and 29.

Here's what it looks like:
